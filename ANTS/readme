ANTS is a little project game which I am working on to practice and develop my Java programming skill, and increase 
my knowledge base in general. I hesitate to upload this work because I feel as if it is very basic and unworthy of being
shared, but my hope is that some of the kids that I look after and try to teach will have access to this code and that it might 
pique their interest in the field of computer science, and science in general.
